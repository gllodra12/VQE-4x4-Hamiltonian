Now, it would be really cool if in the next step we can do a second guess $\\left| \\psi_{2} \\right\\rangle$ with and expected energy $E_{2}$ lower than $E$, so $E_{2} < E$. Indeed this is variational prinicple objective's, we will have a first guess (also called ansatz) with a parameter $\\theta$, such as $\\left| \\psi(\\theta) \\right\\rangle$.

A general approach on how to try different ansatz can be found in qiskit documentation.
